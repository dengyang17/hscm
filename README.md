The preprocessing of ground-truth labels for extractive summarization is based on [this repo](https://github.com/magic282/cnndm_acl18).

### Dataset
- [WikiHowQA](https://github.com/dengyang17/wikihowQA): Only adopt the positive QA samples as the question-driven summarization data
- [PubMedQA](https://github.com/pubmedqa/pubmedqa): The dataset split for the question-driven summarization can be downloaded via the following url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K3sfU3u2pNIu2xd22LiPEyiiQHTZMMnc/view?usp=sharing
